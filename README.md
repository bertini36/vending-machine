## üç∫ Vending machine
**Abacum**'s employees need to be able to have drinks, snacks and refreshments 
within reach, so the company is acquiring a **vending machine** for the office. 
This vending machine comes without pre-installed software (luckily, this machine 
is special and has an unlimited amount of products).

We have to develop the software so that the employees **can add money and the machine 
will count it and of course buy some of the products from the machine**.

## üöÄ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bertini36/vending-machine.git
cd ~/vending-machine

npm install
npm run start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏èTweaks
Some environmental variables can be set to tweak the application, you just need to edit `.env.development`
file and restart the application.
- `REACT_APP_USE_BACKEND`: By default local mocks are used
- `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`: If `REACT_APP_USE_BACKEND` is set to `true`, this variable will be used as the backend url
- `REACT_APP_ENABLE_SOUNDS`: Enable sounds to live the whole experience
